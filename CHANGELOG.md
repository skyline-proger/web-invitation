- Detailed security and privacy documentation in README.md explaining new URL behavior (bc8b4ee)
- Data persistence mechanism that maintains invitation state across browser sessions for 30 days (bc8b4ee)

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: URLs now automatically clean to root path (/) after initial load, hiding wedding UID and guest parameters (bc8b4ee)
- InvitationContext now prioritizes localStorage over URL parameters for data retrieval (bc8b4ee)
- Hero page updated to retrieve guest names from localStorage instead of URL query parameters (bc8b4ee)
- Wishes page updated to retrieve guest names from localStorage instead of URL query parameters (bc8b4ee)

### Migration Guide

For users upgrading from v1.x:

1. **URL Behavior Change**: After guests open their personalized invitation link, the URL will automatically clean to `https://yourdomain.com`. This is expected behavior.

2. **Bookmarks**: Previous bookmarks with full paths will still work on first load, but URLs will clean automatically.

3. **Data Persistence**: Invitation data now persists in browser localStorage for 30 days. Clearing browser data will require guests to click their original link again.

4. **No Server Changes**: This is entirely a client-side change. No backend or database modifications required.
